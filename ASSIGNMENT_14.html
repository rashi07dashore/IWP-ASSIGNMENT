<p>Jung Da-jung (Kim Ha-neul) and Hong Dae-young (Yoon Sang-hyun) are married and have a set 
of fraternal twins, Hong Shi-ah (Roh Jeong-eui) and Hong Shi-woo (Ryeoun [ko]). At first, 
they have a perfect happy marriage despite having children at a very young age and having 
financial problems. Years later, their happy marriage starts crumbling when 37-year-old 
Da-jung files for divorce and their 18-year-old twins start ignoring Dae-young, except for 
pocket money. Furthermore, Dae-young's life turns more miserable when he loses his job, 
after his boss promotes his nephew who has worked in the company for only 4 years, while 
relocating Dae-young to Busan.</p>

<p>Wishing he could go back in time and fix his life, Dae-young's 37-year-old body 
miraculously morphs into the body he had when he was 18 years old (Lee Do-hyun) but retains 
his 37-year-old mentality. He starts living a new life under his alias "Go Woo-young" and 
attends Serim High School, which is his twins' school, and also the school he and Da-jung 
attended 18 years ago. During Dae-young's life as the 18-year-old Go Woo-young, he learns 
that his daughter Shi-ah is working part-time in a convenience store without his permission 
and his son Shi-woo is being abused at school by basketball captain Goo Ja-sung (Hwang In-
yeop). Dae-young also learns about his son's interest and talent in basketball that Shi-woo 
always hides from him. Dae-young eventually realizes the true reason behind his family's 
crumbling bond and gets to know more about his twins. He resolves to use this chance to 
protect his kids by befriending them and to do his best to be more present to the family 
despite his appearance as an 18-year-old boy.</p>

<p>Wishing he could go back in time and fix his life, Hong Dae-young's 37-year-old body 
miraculously morphs into his 18-year-old body but retains his 37-year-old mindset and 
mannerisms. Dae-young starts living a new life as his best friend Go Deok-jin's son "Go 
Woo-young" (he pretended to be a homeschooled teenage son of Deok-jin who lived in USA with 
his non-existent mother) and attends Serim High School, his twins' school, as a Class 2-7 
student. At first, he wants to fulfill his dream of being basketball star and accepted into 
college through a basketball scholarship. However, by attending their school, he gets to 
know things about his twins that he never knew before and, later, the true reason behind 
the crumbling bond between him and the family. He resolves to use this chance to protect 
his kids by befriending them and to do his best to be more present to the family despite 
his appearance as an 18-year-old boy.[c] Later, Woo-young was offered a chance to receive a 
basketball scholarship and get admitted into Hankook University, but Woo-young ultimately
